# About this repo

This repo (`android15-lineage22-mod` branch) is based on [Lineage OS 22.1 xiaomi sm8250 kernel source](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_xiaomi_sm8250).

Originally this repo (`android12-stable-mod` or `android14-stable-mod` branch) is fork from [UtsavBalar1231's repo](https://github.com/UtsavBalar1231/kernel_xiaomi_sm8250), but the `android14-stable` branch has freeze problem when the device sleep for a while or wake up. So now I switched to lineage22 codebase. The MIUI features code and some parts of the drivers is still copied from UtsavBalar1231's branch.

## Thanks

- [@UtsavBalar1231](https://github.com/UtsavBalar1231/) for the original kernel work and MIUI features.
- [@CwithW](https://github.com/CwithW/) for the USB fixes in [PR #61](https://github.com/AstideLabs/android_kernel_xiaomi_sm8250/pull/61) and [PR #62](https://github.com/AstideLabs/android_kernel_xiaomi_sm8250/pull/62).
- [AstideLabs/android_kernel_xiaomi_sm8250](https://github.com/AstideLabs/android_kernel_xiaomi_sm8250) for the source repository and USB fixes.

The main purpose of maintaining and building this kernel is to fix [this battery stuck at 1% problem](https://github.com/liyafe1997/Xiaomi-fix-battery-one-percent), and provide [SukiSU](https://github.com/SukiSU-Ultra/SukiSU-Ultra) (a KernelSU fork with KPM support) as an integrated pre-built image (flashable AnyKernel3 zip). [SUSFS](https://github.com/sidex15/susfs4ksu-module) can be installed separately as a module. Also provides a more intuitive and easy-to-use build script and build guide that allow you to try to build by yourself.

For using the SukiSU, you can install the SukiSU manager APK from [SukiSU Github Release](https://github.com/SukiSU-Ultra/SukiSU-Ultra/releases). For the SUSFS module see [susfs4ksu-module Gihub Release](https://github.com/sidex15/susfs4ksu-module/releases).

(The devices affected by the "1% battery bug" are: alioth, apollo, lmi, thyme, umi, pipa. Because they all use the PM8150, aka Qualcomm fuel gauge GEN4. For the other devices are not affected by that bug, you can use this kernel for KernelSU purpose, as a replacement of the orginal stock kernel. Also, as the people tested, this kernel NoKernelSU version is good for applying [APatch](https://github.com/bmax121/APatch)).

The pre-built kernel image/zip is built on the `android15-lineage22-mod` branch. It should works on both stock MIUI and third-party AOSP based Android 11-15 ROMs. You are welcomed to give feedback (Issues/Pull Requests)!

Note: The zip does not include the `dtbo.img` and it will not replace your `dtbo` partition. It is recommanded to keep the stock `dtbo` or the `dtbo` from your third-party rom (If the builder comfirmed it works well). Since there are some problems with the `dtbo.img` which built from this source, one of them is the screen will suddently goes to the highest brightness when shut try to shut off the screen in the lock screen. If you had flashed any other third-party kernels, and you got some weird problem, you should keep an eye to check your `dtbo` has been replaced or not. 

**Notice: If you are using MIUI/HyperOS please use the MIUI varient. Because the display driver is different between MIUI and AOSP, if you are using MIUI/HyperOS but installed the AOSP version, the display will not work and only black screen. If you only see a black screen after installed this kernel, please check if you installed the correct varient or not!**

Other Features/Improvement of this Kernel:
1. Support USB Serial (CH340/FTDI/PL2303/OTI6858/TI/SPCP8X5/QT2/UPD78F0730/CP210X).
2. Support EROFS.
3. F2FS realtime discard enabled for better TRIM the flash.
4. Support CANBus and USB CAN adapter (like CANable).

# How to build
1. Prepair the basic build environment. 

    You have to have the basic common toolchains, such as `git`, `make`, `curl`, `bison`, `flex`, `zip`, etc, and some other packages.
    In Debian/Ubuntu, you can
    ```
    sudo apt install build-essential git curl wget bison flex zip bc cpio libssl-dev ccache
    ```
    And also, you have to have `python` (only `python3` is not enough). you can install the apt package `python-is-python3`.

    In RHEL/RPM based OS, you can
    ```
    sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
    sudo yum install wget bc openssl-devel ccache
    ```

    Notice: `ccache` is enabled in `build.sh` for speed up the compiling. `CCACHE_DIR` has been set as `$HOME/.cache/ccache_mikernel` in `build.sh`. If you don't like you can remove or modify it.

2. Download [proton-clang] compiler toolchain

    You have to have `aarch64-linux-gnu`, `arm-linux-gnueabi`, `clang`. [Proton Clang](https://github.com/kdrag0n/proton-clang/) is a good prebuilt clang cross compiler toolchain.

    The default toolchain path is `$HOME/proton-clang/proton-clang-20210522/bin` which is set in `build.sh`. If you are using another location please change `TOOLCHAIN_PATH` in `build.sh`.

    ```
    mkdir proton-clang
    cd proton-clang
    wget https://github.com/kdrag0n/proton-clang/archive/refs/tags/20210522.zip
    unzip 20210522.zip
    cd ..
    ```

3. Build

    Build without KernelSU: 
    ```
    bash build.sh TARGET_DEVICE
    ```
    
    Build with KernelSU:
    ```
    bash build.sh TARGET_DEVICE ksu
    ```

    For example, build for lmi (Redmi K30 Pro/POCO F2 Pro) without KernelSU:
    ```
    bash build.sh lmi
    ````

    For example, build for umi (Mi 10) with KernelSU:
    ```
    bash build.sh umi ksu
    ```

    And also, here is a `buildall.sh` can build for all supported models at once.
